This is the project which I created for using Arduino with r307 fingerprint module and 4 x 4 keypad , I2C lcd........
Just connect arduino with all the peripherals and upload the code via Arduino IDE.
The default password will be 1234 which you can also change it by entering a new password in the .ino file(i.e,. the program file)
Make sure the keypad, LCD, and fingerprint module works fine.....
Have fun:-)
